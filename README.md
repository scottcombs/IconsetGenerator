# IconsetGenerator
A small tool to create iconsets and icns files
I made this tool because I was tired of creating all those various icons necessary to satisfy Apple's AppIcon resource. The time I spent in Photoshop and Affinity Photo was better spent on writing new code.
I've created help files, (although I don't think it was necessary), for those who want to know more about iconsets. The video demonstrates the general use of the app.
There is always more that could be done, especially for small tools you only use occasionally.
